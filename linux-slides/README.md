Slideshow for a presentation I gave in June 2019.

Built using https://gitpitch.com/.

(dev branch served at https://gitpitch.com/joecullin/linux-slides/dev)


UPDATE:

It seems like gitpitch.com no longer exists. It was a neat, free interactive presentation site that read from a git repo.

The main slide content is in PITCHME.md, with various images, etc. in assets directory.
