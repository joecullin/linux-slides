# First 90 days



## One-on-ones

Ask to set up a weekly 1-on-1 with your manager.

Don't just talk about project status. Get to know them, talk about life outside work, etc.

It might seem like a waste of time at first, but it's good to have that relationship in place when you need it.


# Journals and notes

Start this on day one.

- Everyone, no matter how smart, hits a limit of what they can keep in their memory.
- The earlier you start this habit, the more natural it will be when you need it.
- Use an app you won't lose between jobs. (Sanitize data, though, and don't leak proprietary info.)
- For meetings: note the time, place, people, then whatever tidbits stand out. Don't try to transcribe the whole thing. Note any commitments/todos for yourself.
- For tough problems: save specific error messages, API response statuses, etc. And times/dates. When everyone else is blurring similar errors in their memory, you'll be able to search your notes and tell if this is the same error that came up four months ago.
- Another benefit: easy multitasking. It won't be hard to shift focus to look at an urgent bug, then come back to whatever you were working on before.
- The Cuckoo's Egg - recommended to me by James. Interesting story, and good example of the value of journals.



## Bad environments

What if you first boss/team/job is a dud?
- toxic culture
- unreasonable boss
- pressure cooker environment
- you'll know within first 90 days
- tough choice - stick it out to get experience?

I'm not an expert on this (thankfully), but as a hiring manager I don't read too much into prior short stints.

As long as you have a reasonable explanation for why you left so quickly, most people won't count it against you.
