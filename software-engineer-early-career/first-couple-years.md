## Role models

Find good role models and/or mentors, people who match your values & aspirations (whatever those are).

- Could be someone on your team, or on another team that you work with.
- Observe how they work, how they act in meetings, etc.
- Ask people about their habits & systems.
- Ask for a regular 1-1 meeting (for example once a month for 30 minutes), if there aren't enough organic ways to strike up conversations. (Don't feel like you're imposing. The other person will be flattered, and it's a chance for them to practice and demonstrate leadership.)
- If you can't find any role models: question whether this is the right company for you.


## Communities

Join some communities, for tech help and for off-topic conversations. You'll get a lot of perspectives outside of your own company's bubble.
- discord - https://www.reactiflux.com/
- slack - https://slofile.com/lang/English/Programming
- more slack - https://medium.com/@singhamritpal49/slack-channels-for-developers-c50ff9aec929
- reddit
- in-person meetups
- etc.

Don't get too addicted to communities (and blogs & newsletters etc.) though. There is unlimited good advice & info, but you need to spend some of your time practicing & doing.

## Ups & downs

Salaries, opportunities, job satisfaction are never linear.

Sometimes it makes sense to take a pay cut in exchange for moving into a more interesting or higher-growth position. Other times you have no choice - layoffs, etc.

Don't be ashamed of moving "backward" -- it's pretty common. People just talk about promotions more loudly.

And don't get hung up on titles. You can describe your role however you want on linkedin, on your resume, etc.


## Specializing too much

At some point you'll wind up being the person who knows a particular part of your company's site/app/codebase better than any of your colleagues. That's a great way, short-term, to build your reputation.

Be careful though. Eventually your team (and even your manager) might hesitate to bring you in to new projects. They'll think it's more efficient & less risky to let new people work on the new stuff, while you tend to the stuff you know best. (It's often the older stuff that makes the most reliable profits, so that's a reasonable bias.)

Some ways to avoid that rut:
- Be open with your manager, and let them know if you start to feel stuck. They value you a lot, and will work hard to keep you happy and let you grow.
- Take long vacations.  If you never really take time off, people can rely on you to run a manual job twice a week. If you take a week-long vacation here & there, your team & boss will recognize the benefits of cross-training others, and of documenting things.
- Build a reputation as someone who can learn new things, tame messy systems, and reliably deliver on commitments. People will be eager to get you on the most important projects.
- Refactor, automate, document, and train others as you go along. Set a reminder every cycle (sprint/month/week) to think about how you can help your teammates have an easier time learning whatever you just learned.



## Other roles

What if it turns out you don't love full-time software engineering, or want a break?

Some adjacent roles that might be appealing:
- QA
- Tech support
- DevOps - blend of operations/sysadmin stuff, using code to automate and streamline tasks.
- Recruiter - you'll have a huge edge (and credibility/trust) because you understand the work.
- Management - working with developers, but more focused on building teams, people, processes, etc.
- Sales Engineer - more-technical member of the sales team, helping to set up demos, help customers do proof-of-concept setups, etc. Often involves some scripting and programming knowledge, but also requires some people & sales skills.
