## Compensation / Salary / Negotiation

This is a classic, and often cited in forums:

Caveats:
- For your first job in a field, getting a good job is more valuable than getting an extra x% salary.
- Every hiring manager and company is different. (Some are even inexperienced or irrational negotiators themselves.)
- Don't take an offer's specifics (or a manager's lack of negotiation) personally. Sometimes the manager isn't allowed to negotiate, and isn't able to explain the full context.
- I personally have gotten a lot of mileage out of not negotiating aggressively. Get your foot in the door, prove yourself quickly, and you'll get raises & promotions soon anyway.


## Resume proofreading

Get help proofreading and editing your resume. I don't mind if you're a terrible speller or not a great writer. But if I get a resume that's loaded with typos, it tells me that person doesn't know how to ask for help from a friend or advisor, or they're not serious enough to do so. 

## Experience

Set aside a few hours a week to keep working on real code.

I've seen a lot of recent applications where people list recent open-source projects as if they're jobs.

Group open source projects are interesting. You can build more, but it's also harder to claim credit for any portion. If it's on your resume, just make sure you can explain it well: even the parts your collaborators worked on.

- Work on an open source project, with a group if you can.
- Show off your code on github.
- Show that you can collaborate with a group.
- If possible: solve a real problem, like for a local charity or a friend's business. You'll be forced to overcome real challenges, compared with being able to pivot every time you're stuck.
- Really deploy your app, so you can get experience with the whole process.
- Interviewers are less interested in seeing your actual code. They want to talk about how you identified and worked through problems.

## Coding interviews
- Resist the temptation to "cram" and learn new tech days before the interview.
- What I'm looking for: can you ask questions and talk about how you're stuck. Even if you've never used the library I ask you to use, you should be able to talk through how it relates to something you do know. (That's what you'll do every day on the job.)


## "Do you have any questions for me?"

> Ask about the product & company.

Spend 20 minutes googling the company and the products, scoping out some employees on linkedin, reading some articles about the company. Then ask some questions to either confirm what you learned, or to dig deeper.
If you've taken that time to learn a little, it will show the interviewer that you care, and it will let them tell a shorter, more interesting story about the role.

> What will my onboarding process be like over the first couple weeks & months?

This helps you understand how much effort they've put into getting you off on the right foot. There's no "right" answer. Maybe they'll have a formal, documented, detailed 30/60/90 day plan for everyone, or weeks of corporate training. Or maybe the hiring manager will give an off-the-cuff, winging-it but also thoughtul & empathetic answer. Either way, it helps you understand the manager's style and also what kind of support you'll get.

> Do you have regular 1-on-1 meetings with all direct reports? Can you describe a typical one?

Gives you a feel for how they'll interact with you. Not everyone does these, but hopefully interviewer will take this prompt to tell you how available they are to the team, and about the various ways the team will support you.





## Consider other roles

If you're not having any luck landing your first software developer/engineer role, consider an adjacent role in a good software company.
- Tech support, sales engineer, QA, IT. (I know a lot of people who've started in all of those before moving into developer roles.)
- First: focus on doing the job you were hired for, and doing it well.
- Learn the business and app(s), and make yourself valuable
- Find ways to make connections with engineering teams
- Be patient
- Find ways to help your current team, with automation scripts, little tools & utilities, etc.
- Don't be shy about discussing your real long-term goals, so people think of you when there's an opening.
