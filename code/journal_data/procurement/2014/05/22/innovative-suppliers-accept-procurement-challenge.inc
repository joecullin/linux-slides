Procurement: \"Challenge suppliers to do more. We drive our teams to be innovative.\" So said Mark Fortney, area vice president of facility solutions at &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/purchasing/profiles/staples\"&gt;Staples Advantage&lt;/a&gt;, to the supply managers attending the education session \"Supplier Management: An Enterprise Capability. A Procurement Opportunity\" at the International Supply Management Conference (ISM2014) recently in Las Vegas. Presenting with Chris Sawchuk, principal of the global procurement advisory at &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/office-products/articles/economy-recovers-procurement-rethinks-role/\"&gt;The Hackett Group&lt;/a&gt;, Fortney provided a supplier perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In the session, Sawchuk used the term \"supplier management\" interchangeably with supplier relationship management (SRM). As he defined it, supplier management is proactive and coordinated -- and to be successful, it requires participation by the entire enterprise. Supplier management encompasses supplier performance monitoring, mitigating risk along the supply chain, and engaging and leveraging supplier capabilities, Sawchuk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=\"http://cfnewsads.thomasnet.com/images/sites/6/2013/09/ISM-Logo.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1399\" alt=\"ISM Logo\" src=\"http://cfnewsads.thomasnet.com/images/sites/6/2013/09/ISM-Logo-300x247.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"247\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As he sees it, \"procurement is the permeable barrier between the organization and the market of suppliers.\" He suggested session attendees segment and understand suppliers -- and engage them. In response, Fortney provided case studies that demonstrate how suppliers approach customers with innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Themes of this presentation were evident throughout the Institute for Supply Management\'s (ISM) 99th annual conference during the education sessions and in exhibitor booths on the show floor. Approximately 2,300 supply managers, procurement professionals, and others attended the three-day event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
At the session \"Bridging the Innovation Gap\", Paul Walker and Sarah Coulter, both innovation sourcing managers at the Clorox Co. and recipient of an ISM Michigan State University Award for Excellence in Supply Management, recalled their experience at engaging and leveraging suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In 2008, Walker, Coulter, and their team accepted a challenge issued by the CEO to help grow the company through innovation -- by its 100th anniversary in 2013. Given that Clorox is smaller than many consumer packaged goods companies, \"we couldn\'t outspend our competitors, so we looked at our partner base,\" Walker said. \"If we tap into it effectively and efficiently, we can box above our weight.\"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
The two shared with session attendees their plan for building a partnering practice -- scout, select, source, and manage -- and recommended procurement work with internal functions such as R&amp;D early in the process. \"Alignment is critical,\" Walker said. \"It gives a higher probability of success.\" And, echoing Fortney of Staples Advantage, he added, \"\'Suppliers -- especially in the past few years -- want to grow too.\"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In addition to the team at Clorox, other recipients of the ISM Michigan State University award who also presented at ISM2014 included the supply management teams at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. and Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
A panel discussion led by Eileen McCullough, operations director, network for value chain excellence, W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, also explored suppliers\' role in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Jill Bossi, formerly vice president and chief procurement officer at the American Red Cross, told session attendees that procurement \"does not rely on suppliers nearly enough\" and used, as an example, her team involving transportation companies UPS and FedEx in facilitating delivery of \"comfort kits\" to people in need. Currently, Bossi is running for U.S. Senate in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Also at the panel discussion, Tom Maher, vice president of global service parts at Dell, shared his experience participating in an Innovation Summit that helped suppliers generate 80 ideas, and suggested attendees consider presenting awards to those that come up with the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Building on a thought that fresh eyes may be better able to find unique solutions, Milton Young, managing director of Mopani Holdings, had an idea of his own for session attendees especially taxed by too few resources: Hire interns in several disciplines from local universities. To sell this to management, he suggests putting together a cost/benefit analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In the session, \"Global Logistics Sourcing--Simplified,\" Mark Chadwick, global transportation manager at GE Corporate, described the process the procurement team uses to source ocean freight that leverages the buys of several companies through the Global Shippers Association, which provides group negotiation services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Since GE does not mandate that its businesses use agreements negotiated by its corporate procurement team, Chadwick suggests to supply managers \"to try to make sure the businesses are actively involved in all steps of the process.\" As such, there will be \"no surprises,\" and the businesses \"can implement something they truly believe in.\" In keeping with the SRM theme, he also recommended including the businesses in quarterly business reviews that track the performance of suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Optimistic on the Economy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Supply managers attending the ISM Business Survey presentation left the session optimistic about prospects for the U.S. and global economy through 2015. Despite some challenges, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\'s Analytics, is forecasting GDP growth of 3.5 percent for this year and next, with much of that activity coming from developed nations. Zandi also had positive things to say about the U.S. job market (improving) and commodity prices (remaining relatively stable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
At the same time, the ISM Spring 2014 Semiannual Economic Forecast shows growth is expected to continue in the United States through the rest of the year. The forecast was given by Brad Holcomb, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, and Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM Non-Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In the &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/purchasing/media/videos\"&gt;ISM2014 exhibit hall&lt;/a&gt;, D&amp;B demonstrated its new Supplier Risk Manager 2.0 while Invalua detailed functionality of its Ivalua Buyer V8 product to supply managers who stopped by their booths. Wheels Inc., recipient of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/office-products/articles/indirect-procurement-recognized-for-professional-excellence/\"&gt;My Purchasing Center Excellence in Purchasing Indirect Categories (EPIC) Supplier Award in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, also met with attendees and filled them in on their capabilities, including their driver support services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Recipients of the&lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/mro-indirect/industry-articles/epic-awards-define-procurement-excellence/\"&gt; 2014 EPIC Awards&lt;/a&gt; were on hand as well to give presentations to conference attendees. Bill Mangen, executive director of strategic sourcing for Cox Communications, spoke on \"Building a Strategic Sourcing House, (&lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/purchasing/media/webcast/mpc-webcast2014-epic-awards-exceeding-expectations-indirect-procurement/\"&gt;EPIC Team Award&lt;/a&gt;), and Curtis McEntire, president and founder of Mazree, talked about \"Using Social Media in the Indirect Spend\" (EPIC Innovator Award).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In addition to the awards, ISM took the opportunity to make several other announcements during the conference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ISM and the Ethisphere Institute formed a partnership to launch the Supplier Risk Index, an online resource for organizations to survey practices of suppliers along the supply chain. This new tool, Bill Michels, senior vice president at ISM, told My Purchasing Center, will help supply managers in their efforts to mitigate supplier risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ISM and ThomasNet (publisher of ThomasNet News) formed a partnership to honor supply managers embarking upon their careers with the &lt;a href=\"http://www.thomasnet.com/30under30/\"&gt;30 Under 30 Rising Supply Chain Stars Recognition Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ISM named former ISM CEO Paul Novak the 2014 J. Shipman Gold Medal Award recipient. The award honors an individual who has performed distinguished service for the cause and advancement of the supply management profession.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
ISM2014 sponsors included Zycus (platinum and technology), ADTRAV, LexisNexis, POOL4TOOL America (gold), Ariba, Enrich, &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/purchasing/profiles/staples\"&gt;Staples Advantage&lt;/a&gt; (silver), A.T. Kearney Procurement &amp; Analytic Solutions (bronze), and Puridiom (associate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
The My Purchasing Center team manned a booth on the show floor, and publisher Michelle Palmer co-presented at a session for ISM affiliate leaders, \"You Too Can Be a Webmaster.\" My Purchasing Center hosts websites for such ISM affiliates and groups as &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/purchasing/profiles/ism-greater-rhode-island/\"&gt;ISM--Greater Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.mypurchasingcenter.com/purchasing/profiles/ism-risk-management/\"&gt;Supply Chain Risk Management group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In 2015, ISM celebrates its 100th anniversary. The annual conference is scheduled for May 3-6 in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
